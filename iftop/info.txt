The first two log files, log.txt and log2.txt, show the logging info from iftop when analysing the output from the Raspberry Pi box through the ethernet port eth0.

The third log file, log3.txt, shows the logging info from the wlan0 port of the RPi3 (the wireless reciever which devices connect to).

It is my guess that log3 will prove more useful than log1 and log2, but our data analysis will tell us which interface we should be logging.
